  <h2>Course Details:</h2>
  <p>
    In this course, students will study basic web application development with front-end
    (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities 
    and attacks will be introduced and explored with hands-on exercises on the range. 
    Secure programming principles and practices will be introduced to avoid potential 
    web application vulnerabilities and attacks.

  <h2>Lab 1:</h2>
  <p>
    In this extensive lab, I went into the deep world of HTTP protocols, using Wire-
    shark to examine HTTP Request and Response messages, as well as HTTP Streams. 
    The hands-on tasks included using telnet to send simple HTTP re-
    quests and inspecting the resulting messages in Wireshark. Transitioning to web
    application programming, I created CGI scripts in C and PHP pages, demon-
    strating the ability to properly deploy and invoke these apps. Wireshark analysis
    and curl were used to gain a better understanding of HTTP GET and POST
    requests. Throughout these activities, the lab not only sharpened my technical
    skills but also highlighted the importance of security considerations in web ap-
    plications, giving me a solid foundation for navigating the complexity of HTTP
    and web development.

  <h2>Lab 2:</h2>
  <p>
    This lab focuses on real web development exercises, covering subjects such as
    HTML, JavaScript, Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and Web API integration. In Task 1,
    I developed a simple HTML file containing basic elements, an image, and a
    form, and then used JavaScript to display the current date/time, log key presses,
    show/hide email, and display digital and analog clocks. Task 2 digs deeper
    into complex topics such as Ajax for handling asynchronous queries, CSS for
    decorating the webpage, jQuery for simplifying JavaScript code, and the use of
    Web APIs to fetch and display dynamic data. By completing these assignments,
    I acquired hands-on experience developing interactive and dynamic online apps,
    which helped me better comprehend fundamental web development concepts
    and approaches.
