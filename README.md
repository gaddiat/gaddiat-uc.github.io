## Front-end Web Development with a Professional Profile Website on github.io cloud service

## Overview and Requirements 

In this project, you will expand front-end web development skills by developing a Professional Profile Website and deploying it on `github.io` cloud service. This project has general, non-technical, and technical requirements with grade distributions as follows.

The goal of this project is to create and launch a polished GitHub profile page that will attract employers. The website has a thorough resume section as well as a page devoted to explaining the "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course. With an open-source CSS framework like as Bootstrap, the design is improved. The website also includes additional technological components, such integrated public Web APIs for dynamic data retrieval, JavaScript cookies for a customized user experience, and JavaScript features developed with jQuery and other libraries. All things considered, the project demonstrates proficiency with front-end programming as well as a grasp of useful web application ideas.


### General requirements (30 pts): 

+ Create and deploy a personal website on GitHub cloud (github.io) as a professional profile with your resume, including your name, headshot, contact information, background, e.g., education, your experiences and skills (25 pts).
 ​

 + Course Introduction Page: Make a link that points to a fresh HTML page that describes the course "Web Application Programming and Hacking" as well as pertinent practical exercises.



### Non-technical requirements (20 pts)​

+ Use an open-source CSS template or framework such as Bootstrap​

_Target this profile for your potential employer, and your page will be graded as a part of your job application​_

+ Two public Web APIs integration (20 pts)​

1. Integrate the jokeAPI ([https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any), similar to Lab 2.2.d.i) with Any category of joke to display a new joke in your page every 1 minute

+ Use JavaScript cookies to remember the client (10 pts): If first-time visit, display a message "Welcome to my homepage!", otherwise, display a message "Welcome back! Your last visit was <the date/time of last visit>"



+ Basic JavaScript Code: Add a digital clock, an analog clock, the ability to show or conceal emails, and one more feature of your choosing.
+ JavaScript Framework/Library: To implement the functionality, use jQuery together with one additional open-source JavaScript framework/library.
